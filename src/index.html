  <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra">About-Petra</a>
        

        <p> The history of Petra is long, its valley was highly valued for its easy defense. However, its first inhabitants were nomads , there are no physical traces of the homes other than from the Nabataean era , since this civilization built and lived there for a long time. After the Byzantine period, the place is practically abandoned, so there are few sources that evoke that time, making it difficult to reconstruct the history of the city over a long period. After the rediscovery of the city by Jean Louis Burckhardt in 1812, many sources evoking the history of Petra have been found in ancient writings.</p>
